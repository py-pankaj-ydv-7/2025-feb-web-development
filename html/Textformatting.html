     <p>A <strong> blockchain </strong>is a distributed ledger with <em> growing lists of records</em> (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes. <sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup> Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,<strong> H<sub>2</sub>O </strong> a <del>timestamp</del>, and <ins><mark>hello i am pankaj yadav </mark></ins>transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. <br><br> Consequently, blockchain transactions are resistant to alteration because, once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be changed retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks and obtaining network consensus to accept these changes.
